Version 0.7.0

* Change abnormal interface to handle sorted
  and unsorted SAM/BAM files.

* processing-sample subcommand automatically
  detects if the alignment file is queryname
  sorted or not and then choose the right
  abnormal interface.

* Add a new table 'schema' with a single column
  called 'version'. Its function is to keep
  track of the database schema state in a
  versioned way.

Version 0.6.0

* Add DBSCAN algorithm - Density-Based Spatial
  Clustering of Applications with Noise. Its
  purpose is making an one-dimensional
  groupping of all reads per chromosome.

* Add CLI - Command Line Interface - based
  in subcommands: For now, there are two
  subcommands: processing-sample (alias
  ps) and merge-call (alias mc).

* Add low-level wrappers on SQLite3 functions
  in order to avoid so many testing against
  each statement.

* Improve testing coverage with gcov, lcov
  and COVERALLS platform.

Version 0.5.0

* Add a 'str' interface to handle string
  memory manipulation more efficiently.

* 'ibitree' lookup mechanism reshaped: Besides
  the range to search for, it acceps now node,
  interval overlapped fractions and the bitwise
  boolean (AND or OR) for testing if both, node
  and interval must overlap each other at the
  same percentage - or if just one being true
  is enough. Also, 'ibitree' keeps track of the
  position and length of overlapping regions.

* Add 'thpool' interface for thread pool.

* Add 'SQLite3' library to manage intermediate
  and possibly final results.

* 'abnormal' filtering is working. It selects
  the so called abnormal alignments: Thoses
  alignments, whose each sequenced read of the
  fragment falls into different chromosomes, or
  is far way from its mate. Also it catches
  supplementary alignments. All the results
  are recorded into the 'SQLite3' database.

* Add 'exon' interface. Its job is seach for
  abnormal alignments that overlap some exon.

Version 0.4.0

* Add an 'align' interface to save 'bwa mem'
  output in 'bwa' format.

* Borrow the 'samtools sort' algorithm and
  implement it at sam_sort interface.

* Add a 'binary tree' data structure and, on top
  of it, implement an 'AVL interval tree' to handle
  searching genomic annotation positons more
  efficiently.

* Add processing text interface to read 'gff/gtf'
  file format.

* Initiate 'abnormal' filter algorithm.

Version 0.3.0

* Use 'git submodule' to handle local building of
  'htslib' and 'bwa'. Those codes are statically
  linked against our software.

* Add 'bwa mem' and 'sam' wrappers.

Version 0.2.0

* Add array, list and hash data structures.

* Add logging interface to manage messages level.

* Wrapping of standard c functions for allocating
  memory and opening file.

Version 0.1.0

* Initial version. Project was set to work with
  'autotools' and testing with the framework 'check'.
